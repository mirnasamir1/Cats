    <h2>Many cat owners think of <a href="https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-food/wet">wet cat food</a> as a treat because their cats love it so much. In reality, you can feed your cat wet food regularly,<br> not just as an occasional treat.<br></h2>
    <p>It can be tricky to determine how much wet food to feed a cat at a time, though. The total amount of wet food you should provide them can depend on several factors.<br>
         They include how much dry kibble you feed them, their overall health and more,<mark>including:</mark></p>
     <ul>
        <li><b>Age and Life Stage:</b> Kittens have different nutritional needs than adult or senior cats and need a specially formulated <a href="https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-food/kitten-food">kitten food</a>. How much wet food to feed a kitten is different from how much to feed an adult cat. </li>
        <li><b>Weight:</b> If your cat is not at their ideal weight, you may need to give them smaller or larger portions to help them achieve and maintain a <a href="https://www.purina.com/articles/cat/health/what-is-average-cat-weight">healthy weight</a>. </li>
        <li><b>Energy Level:</b> Cats who are active and playful throughout the day may require more calories than those who prefer to spend their time napping. </li>
        <li><b>Type of Food:</b> Wet and <a href="https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-food/dry">dry cat food</a> differ in calories, as well as portion sizes. You’ll want to ensure you’re feeding an appropriate amount of food, whether you feed wet, dry or a combination of the two.  </li>
